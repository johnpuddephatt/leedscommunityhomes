### What is community-led housing?

Community-led housing is a term that’s used to describe housing that is developed by local people, to meet the housing needs of local people. At Leeds Community Homes we’re interested in finding ways to help local people to work together to meet their own housing needs. There are various ways that that can happen – such as co-housing (like at [LILAC in Bramley](http://www.lilac.coop/), housing co-ops, or through affordable homes being built by a Community Land Trust.

### Do we need more homes in Leeds?

Many people in our city struggle to find an affordable home to rent or buy. That’s why we’ve set up Leeds Community Homes – to find ways to build and refurbish homes that will be permanently affordable for Leeds people. We also want to find ways to build more environmentally sustainable homes – whilst also exploring ways to contribute to making Leeds a better place for all of us to live. To make this happen we are establishing ourselves as a Community Land Trust – and raising money through a community share issue.

### What is a community share issue?

Communities around the country are raising funds through community share issues. The short video below explains how.

Community shares offer an ideal way for communities to invest in initiatives that serve a community purpose. Leeds Community Homes is registered as a Community Benefit Society – which means we can offer people the opportunity to invest in community shares.

We launched a community share offer in 2016 – to raise finance to fund the purchase and renovation of empty homes – which will then be made available for affordable rent.

### What is a Community Land Trust?

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are non-profit, community-based organisations that develop housing and other assets that meet the needs of the community. They provide homes to rent and buy at permanently affordable levels.

Leeds Community Homes recently received £10,000 from the Community Land Trust Network to develop as a Community Land Trust for Leeds.

### Who’s involved with Leeds Community Homes?

There are currently seven founder members of Leeds Community Homes – who worked together during 2015 to develop plans for setting up a Community Land Trust for Leeds. Between them they have a wide range of experience in community-led housing and social enterprise, alongside a real passion for creating homes that can make Leeds a better place to live.
