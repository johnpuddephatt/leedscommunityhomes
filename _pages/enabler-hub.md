**It can be more than a little daunting starting your own community led housing scheme. At Leeds Community Homes we help groups do just that.**

We are an Enabler Hub which means we work with community and voluntary groups, community land trusts, local authorities, developers, housing associations and more to create new community led housing schemes.

The areas we can provide support and help are broad - from helping you form your group and work out what kind of community led housing you would like to develop, through helping with design and planning permission, to project managing the build.

### **How does our support work?**

#### Step 1:

The first step is to complete our online health check [support questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG5zIuLRihBdx0qpyis0tDBmBt4ekhKLQ3pC6Y6KTaokCg5A/viewform?usp=sf_link "support questionnaire"). This will help us to see where you are up to and what support and help you might need.

Your answers identify the areas youâ€™ll need to work on and will help us see whether or not we can help you. We may also signpost you to other potential sources of help and support.

#### Step 2:

The next stage will be for your group to get really clear and ready about what you want to achieve and what you want to do. This will involve having a clear vision for your scheme, knowing what governance arrangements, legal and ownership structure you want, and good group development.

We have a check list of all the things you need to cover at this stage, and we may be able to help. To start there's a foundation workshop. We can also link you to or directly help you with other specific topic workshops and access to loads of resources. We will identify and help groups we are working with apply for possible sources of funding.

#### Step 3:

In stage 3, we can work with some groups on their actual brief or plan, right up to full business plan, design, financing and planning permission. Our support at this stage can include direct help and advice, writing documents and plans, working on costings and the practical aspects of your brief, group work, training and workshops, project management.

### **Do we need to pay for your support?**

If we are able to help you, depending on your group and proposal we may be able to provide this support free of charge or help you to apply for funding to pay for it. Or, we will talk to you about doing this as fee paying consultancy work.

### **Who provides the support?**

Support is either provided by LCH staff or a group of carefully selected, specialist associates.
