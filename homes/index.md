description: We’re building 16 permanently affordable homes in Leeds’ Climate Innovation District
---
In January 2017 we successfully raised £360,000 through a community share offer to create our first sixteen People Powered Homes, as part of Leeds’ emerging [Climate Innovation District](https://www.citu.co.uk/citu-places/climate-innovation-district/), which is just a stone’s throw from our [Hub](/homes/).

## How our new homes will make a difference
We’ll rent out nine of our first sixteen homes, and sell seven. All the homes will be permanently affordable – with the rental homes being rented at a “social rent”, whilst the homes we sell will be available at around 2/3 of full market value.  As a [Community Land Trust](http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt) we will ensure that all the homes will be permanently affordable.

We expect our first homes to be available during 2019.  For more information, see our [share offer prospectus and business plan](/).

## Future projects
We are currently working on plans for creating more People Powered Homes – so that we can make progress towards our long term goal of being involved in creating 1000 permanently affordable homes.  The latest news is [available on our blog](/blog/).
