description: We support local community groups to create their own community housing
---
Thanks to generous support from Power To Change (who also invested in our [community share offer](https://www.powertochange.org.uk/stories/leeds-community-homes/))  we are currently piloting a support service for emerging community-led housing projects in the Leeds City Region.

Throughout 2018 we will provide intensive support to at least three community-led housing groups that want to create permanently affordable, community-led housing.  We know how challenging this can be – and we want to use our expertise to give them every chance of success.

## Groups we’re currently supporting

Supporting others to create People Powered Homes – as well as building homes ourselves – is central to how we want to be involved in creating 1000 permanently affordable homes over the next ten years. Groups we are currently supporting include:

- [Otley Community Land Trust](https://otleyclt.wordpress.com/about/) - a group of people working on plans for community ownership for a range of assets in Otley – including permanently affordable housing.
- An emerging student housing co-op in Leeds – part of wider student housing coop movement across the UK
- [Yorspace](http://yorspace.org/) - a group of people developing plans for affordable, sustainable homes in York

If you are exploring setting up a community-led housing project, and would be interested in us supporting you – [please get in touch](/contact/).
