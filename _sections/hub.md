With support from [Power To Change](https://www.powertochange.org.uk/funding/sector-funding/community-housing/), we’ve established a community-led housing hub in Cross Green, on the outskirts of Leeds city centre.

## Facilities
We’ve got desk space and meeting rooms for people who are creating People Powered Homes – and we host events for our members here too.

## Using the hub
If you’d like to meet or work from here, please [get in touch](/contact/).
