Our second AGM will take place on Wednesday 27 June from 7pm until 9pm at the Rainbow Junktion cafe, at All Hallows Church in Hyde Park, Leeds.

The Rainbow Junktion cafe is part of the Real Junk Food Project network, and uses food that would otherwise go to waste to produce delicious three course meals, two lunchtimes a week.  They also run regular bistro nights.

Our AGM will begin promptly at 7.30pm, with teas and coffees served from 7pm. We will finish by 9pm.

Leeds Community Homes members can also join us for a Pay As You Feel meal in the cafe at 6pm.  This will be an opportunity to enjoy a meal made from ingredients that would otherwise have gone to waste, and of course a chance to chat with other LCH members.

Members are free just to turn up the AGM, from 7pm, although if you know you are coming, we would appreciate it if you were to [sign up here]( https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-community-homes-2018-agm-tickets-45587316892) (to give us an idea of numbers).

If you would like to join us for the Pay As You Feel meal too, at 6pm, please [sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-community-homes-2018-agm-tickets-45587316892).

We are inviting members to consider standing for election to our Board of Directors.  If you are interesting in joining our Board, please contact us for an informal chat - so we can tell you more about what’s involved, and then explain how to put yourself forward for election.

If you are support the aims of Leeds Community Homes, and would like to get involved, you are free to apply to be a member, by paying £1.  If you would like more information about becoming a member, [please contact us](/contact/).
