About you .....

**What’s it like working at Leeds Community Homes…….?**

Leeds Community Homes currently has 3 members of staff - who are often out and about. We also have some associates working from the office at different times. When all 3 are in its busy, but at other times it can be quiet. The office is nice and warm, the building is home to LEDA Architects and shared with other organisations including Zero Waste Leeds, the Empty Homes Doctor and Angels.

Leeds Community Homes is a great place to work.

Our values and ethics are really important to us and its essential that everyone who works here shares those.

LCH prides itself on being a very friendly, open, happy, supportive, informal place to work. But we have a lot of demands on our time and so we have a lot to do and get through. But there’s always a lot of healthy food in the office - be warned!

#### **Where is the job?………**

Based in LCH’s office in Cross Green - a 5-10 minute cycle ride from town or 15/20 mins walk from the Minster. There’s parking outside the building. The job will mainly be office based but can at times be worked remotely by agreement.
