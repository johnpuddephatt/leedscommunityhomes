description: We support local community groups to create their own community housing
---
Thanks to generous support from Power To Change (who also invested in our [community share offer](https://www.powertochange.org.uk/stories/leeds-community-homes/))  we are currently piloting a support service for emerging community-led housing projects in the Leeds City Region.

Throughout 2018 we will provide intensive support to at least three community-led housing groups that want to create permanently affordable, community-led housing.  We know how challenging this can be – and we want to use our expertise to give them every chance of success.

If you are exploring setting up a community-led housing project, and would be interested in us supporting you – [please get in touch](/contact/).
