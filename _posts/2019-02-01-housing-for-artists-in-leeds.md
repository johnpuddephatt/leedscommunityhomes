Leeds Community Homes are currently working with Leeds arts development organisation East Street Arts on a new scheme for artists housing. Still in the early stages of development, we're looking at possible viability of an exciting historic site on the edge of the city centre, combining homes and working space for artists.

Back in November, East Street Arts hosted a special event exploring the possible impact artists can have on the housing crisis. Individuals from across the sectors came together with experts in the field. Our Associate, Peg Alexander went along and she has written a [Guest Blog for East Street Arts](https://eaststreetarts.org.uk/fluxcapacitor/housing-for-artists-a-guest-blog-by-peg-alexander/ "Guest Blog for East Street Arts") on her experience of the day.
