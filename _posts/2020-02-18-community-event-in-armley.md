**Hello!  
Thanks to everyone who came along to our consultation event on 1st Feb.**

**We will be holding another community event on 29th Feb to show how the designs have progressed with community input from the previous event.**

**So come along to Westerly Croft on Saturday 29th Feb between 10.30 â€“ 2pm.  
There will be free refreshments and activities for kids.**   
**If you weren't able to come down last time please feel free to come down and find out what it's all about.  
  
A bit of background:**  
**Leeds Community Homes is planning to build 34 new homes along Mistress Lane in Armley. We would also like to develop the greenspace around the site to benefit all the neighbours too.**

**If you would like to be part of the steering group for a new Community Garden? Come along or email info@leedscommunityhomes.org.uk**
