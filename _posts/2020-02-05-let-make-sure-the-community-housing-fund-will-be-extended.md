We are supporting [The National Community Land Trust Network](http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/) campaign to extend the Community Housing Fund for five years in **the Spring Budget**, which will take place on Wednesday **11 March 2020**. We want to see community led housing to become a mainstream housing option that is available to people across the country.

The Fund has helped to create a pipeline of over 16,600 homes, but community groups will struggle to realise their plans if it is not extended beyond March 2020.

Envisaged as a five-year fund, delays have meant the Homes England part of the Fund was only open to bids for 18 months.

The Government has committed to supporting community housing in its [manifesto](http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/article/2019/11/27/what-do-the-manifestos-say-on-clts-and-community-led-housing-and-what-does-it-mean-for-us-all) and should now deliver on this promise.
