Our festive peer-to-peer group learning social & networking event will take place on Wednesday 11th December in Leeds at 6pm.  
  
Our last event was well attended and people gave us feedback that it was a great opportunity to meet and learn from other people and groups doing Community Led Housing in a variety of ways around the region. 

* Venue: [Leeds Brewery Tap](https://brewerytapleeds.co.uk/), Leeds City centre
* Timings roughly 6-8pm but stay longer if you want
