**People Powered Homes are coming to Armley!**

at Mistress Lane, Westerly Rise

**Saturday 1st Feb 10.30 – 2pm**

**Leeds Community Homes are planning to build 32 new homes along Mistress Lane in Armley, and while we do it we’d like to develop the greenspace around the site to benefit all the neighbours too.**

**We’d like to hear from people living locally, people who travel through the site and overlook it particularly so you can have a space that you love.**

**We’re holding an event to get to know the locals, there will be free refreshments activities for kids and a chance to have your say about the greenspace.**

**1st Feb on the flat area outside Westerly Rise. If the weather’s wet we’ll be in the foyer.** 

**A bit about the homes:**

**These homes will be super insulated to reduce fuel bills and help with the climate emergency. We’re using an innovative building technique which means the community can help to build them!**

**Some of the homes will be available to people on the council housing list, some could be rented directly through LCH and some could be bought through a part ownership scheme. Priority will be for people already living in Armley.**

**The build is likely to start Jan 2021 and people could be moving in around Jan 2022.**

**If you’re interested in maybe buying one of the part ownership homes, or you’d like to try out your skills with the community build element then come along for a chat and a cuppa or email info@leedscommunityhomes.org.uk**
