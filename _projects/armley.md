  ## Why are we doing this?

  Leeds Community Homes is a Community Land Trust – and our aim is to help to create permanently affordable homes to rent and buy in Leeds.

  We set up in 2016 – and last year we raised over £360,000 towards our first sixteen homes.  We’ve got big ambitions to build many more.

We’re looking at a piece of land in Armley with potential for new homes.  It’s early days – and creating affordable housing is never easy – but we’ll do all we can to make it work.

If this is to happen, we’ll need the people of Armley involved. People who might be interested in living in one of the homes, and people who’d like to see more affordable homes in their neighbourhood.

Might that be you?  It’d be great to tell you more about where we’re up to – and to get your thoughts on how we could make this work in Armley. If you're interested, please join us at **our upcoming event** or [get in touch](mailto:armley@leedscommunityhomes.org.uk).
