<p>Community-led housing is a term that’s used to describe housing that is developed by local people, to meet the housing needs of local people. At Leeds Community Homes we’re interested in finding ways to help local people to work together to meet their own housing needs. There are various ways that that can happen – such as co-housing (like at <a href="http://www.lilac.coop/">LILAC in Bramley</a>, housing co-ops, or through affordable homes being built by <a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">a Community Land Trust</a>.</p>

<h3 id="do-we-need-more-homes-in-leeds">Do we need more homes in Leeds?</h3>

<p>Many people in our city struggle to find an affordable home to rent or buy. That’s why we’ve set up Leeds Community Homes – to find ways to build and refurbish homes that will be permanently affordable for Leeds people. We also want to find ways to build more environmentally sustainable homes – whilst also exploring ways to contribute to making Leeds a better place for all of us to live.</p>

<p>To make this happen we have set ourselves up as a Community Land Trust, and we’re doing a range of things to create People Powered Homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last year we raised £360,000 through a community share offer to fund our first sixteen homes</li>
  <li>With support from <a href="https://www.powertochange.org.uk">Power To Change</a>, we have established a community-led housing hub to provide space for people to develop ideas for community-led housing</li>
  <li>With support from <a href="https://www.powertochange.org.uk">Power To Change</a> we are piloting a support service for groups of people who want to create permanently affordable, community-led housing</li>
</ul>

<p>Communities around the country are raising funds through community share issues. The short video below explains how.</p>

<p>Community shares offer an ideal way for communities to invest in initiatives that serve a community purpose. Leeds Community Homes is registered as a Community Benefit Society – which means we can offer people the opportunity to invest in community shares.</p>

<p>Our first community share offer – to support the creation of <a href="/homes/">our first sixteen People Powered Homes</a> – was launched in October 2016 – and we reached our £360,000 target in January 2018.</p>

<p>Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are non-profit, community-based organisations that develop housing and other assets that meet the needs of the community. They provide homes to rent and buy at permanently affordable levels.</p>

<p>In 2017 Leeds Community Homes received £10,000 from the Community Land Trust Network to develop as a Community Land Trust for the Leeds area.</p>
