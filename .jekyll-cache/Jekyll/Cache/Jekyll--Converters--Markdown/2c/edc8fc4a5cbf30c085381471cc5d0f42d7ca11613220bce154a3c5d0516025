I"½<p><strong>Leeds Community Homes are planning to build 34 new homes along Mistress Lane in Armley, we would also like to develop the greenspace around the site to benefit all the neighbours too.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weâ€™d like to hear from people living locally, people who travel through the site and overlook it particularly so you can have a space that you love.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A bit about the homes:</strong></p>

<p><strong>These homes will be super insulated to reduce fuel bills and help with the climate emergency. Weâ€™re using an innovative building technique and are hoping the community can be involved in the consultation process!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some of the homes will be available to people on the council housing list, some could be rented directly through LCH and some could be bought through a part ownership scheme. Priority will be for people already living in Armley.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Itâ€™d be great to tell you more about where weâ€™re up to â€“ and to get your thoughts on how we could make this work in Armley. If youâ€™re interested, please</strong> <a href="mailto:info@leedscommunityhomes.org.uk"><strong>get in touch</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
