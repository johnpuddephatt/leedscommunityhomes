I"ç<p><strong>People Powered Homes are coming to Armley!</strong></p>

<p>at Mistress Lane, Westerly Rise</p>

<p><strong>Saturday 1st Feb 10.30 â€“ 2pm</strong></p>

<p><strong>Leeds Community Homes are planning to build 32 new homes along Mistress Lane in Armley, and while we do it weâ€™d like to develop the greenspace around the site to benefit all the neighbours too.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weâ€™d like to hear from people living locally, people who travel through the site and overlook it particularly so you can have a space that you love.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weâ€™re holding an event to get to know the locals, there will be free refreshments activities for kids and a chance to have your say about the greenspace.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1st Feb on the flat area outside Westerly Rise. If the weatherâ€™s wet weâ€™ll be in the foyer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A bit about the homes:</strong></p>

<p><strong>These homes will be super insulated to reduce fuel bills and help with the climate emergency. Weâ€™re using an innovative building technique which means the community can help to build them!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some of the homes will be available to people on the council housing list, some could be rented directly through LCH and some could be bought through a part ownership scheme. Priority will be for people already living in Armley.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The build is likely to start Jan 2021 and people could be moving in around Jan 2022.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If youâ€™re interested in maybe buying one of the part ownership homes, or youâ€™d like to try out your skills with the community build element then come along for a chat and a cuppa or email info@leedscommunityhomes.org.uk</strong></p>
