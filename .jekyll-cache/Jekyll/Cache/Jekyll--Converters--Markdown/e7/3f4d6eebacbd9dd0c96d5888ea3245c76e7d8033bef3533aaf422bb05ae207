I"”<p>We are supporting <a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">The National Community Land Trust Network</a> campaign to extend the Community Housing Fund for five years in <strong>the Spring Budget</strong>, which will take place on Wednesday <strong>11 March 2020</strong>. We want to see community led housing to become a mainstream housing option that is available to people across the country.</p>

<p>The Fund has helped to create a pipeline of over 16,600 homes, but community groups will struggle to realise their plans if it is not extended beyond March 2020.</p>

<p>Envisaged as a five-year fund, delays have meant the Homes England part of the Fund was only open to bids for 18 months.</p>

<p>The Government has committed to supporting community housing in its <a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/article/2019/11/27/what-do-the-manifestos-say-on-clts-and-community-led-housing-and-what-does-it-mean-for-us-all">manifesto</a> and should now deliver on this promise.</p>
