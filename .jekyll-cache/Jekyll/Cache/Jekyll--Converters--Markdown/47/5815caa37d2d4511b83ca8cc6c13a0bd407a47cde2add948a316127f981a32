I"9<p>Leeds Community Homes is delighted to announce that we are one of the sixteen community land trusts that have been awarded a share of the National CLT Network’s Cohesive Communities funding to strengthen their membership base and be champions of inclusivity, equality and diversity!</p>

<p>This flexible funding will help Leeds Community Homes to engage with more people within the Leeds community to ensure plans genuinely reflect the needs and voices of local people.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2019/10/14/D3O9_RBW4AIZmqA.jpg" alt="" />We will be working with Community leader, Claude Hendrickson, who led Frontline Self Build in Leeds - a self build project where he and 12 other unemployed men built a street from scratch, learning the skills along the way. Claude is hugely experienced in community and self build projects and was a founder member of the national <a href="https://www.communityselfbuildagency.org.uk/">Community Self Build Agency</a> (CSBA).</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to getting started in the coming weeks…</p>
