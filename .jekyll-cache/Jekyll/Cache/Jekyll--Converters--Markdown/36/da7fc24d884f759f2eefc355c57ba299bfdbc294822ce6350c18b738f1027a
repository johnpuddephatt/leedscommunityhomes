I"Ä<p>In January 2017 we successfully raised ¬£360,000 through a community share offer to create our first sixteen People Powered Homes, as part of Leeds‚Äô emerging <a href="https://www.citu.co.uk/citu-places/climate-innovation-district/">Climate Innovation District</a>, which is just a stone‚Äôs throw from our <a href="/homes/">Hub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-our-new-homes-will-make-a-difference">How our new homes will make a difference</h2>

<p>Our homes are being built Citu, the local developer behind the Climate Innovation District. The affordable homes have been made available to us through a Section 106 agreement - an agreement between the developer and the Local Authority to provide affordable housing.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll rent out nine of our first sixteen homes, and sell seven. All the homes will be permanently affordable ‚Äì with the rental homes being rented at a ‚Äúsocial rent‚Äù, whilst the homes we sell will be available at around 2/3 of full market value.  As a <a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt">Community Land Trust</a> we will ensure that all the homes will be permanently affordable.</p>

<p>We expect our first homes to be available during 2019.  For more information, see our <a href="/uploads/2019/02/01/LCH Share Offer Final.pdf" title="LCH Share Offer Final.pdf">Share Offer Prospectus</a>.</p>

<p>We are currently working on plans for creating more People Powered Homes ‚Äì so that we can make progress towards our long term goal of being involved in creating 1000 permanently affordable homes.  The latest news is <a href="/blog/">available on our blog</a>.</p>
